📰 Blogs App

A mini React.js project that displays a list of blog posts fetched from a JSON server using a custom React hook. The app also uses React Router for navigation between pages (Home and About).

This project helped me practice data fetching, custom hooks, and routing in React — all fundamental concepts for building modern web apps.

🚀 Features

📡 Fetch blog data dynamically from a JSON server

🧩 Custom React Hook for data fetching logic

🧭 Navigation using React Router DOM (v6)

🧱 Clean and reusable component structure

💅 Simple, minimal, and responsive UI design
