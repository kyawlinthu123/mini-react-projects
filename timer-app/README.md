# ‚è±Ô∏è Timer & Stopwatch App

A simple React app that includes both a stopwatch and a countdown timer.  
Built to practice state management, refs, and interval handling with React hooks.

## üöÄ Features

- Stopwatch mode: start, stop, and reset the time  
- Timer mode: set a countdown and start/stop/reset it  
- Time format: **HH:MM:SS:MS** (hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)  
- Responsive and minimal UI with distinct button colors  

## üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Practiced

- `useState` for managing running state, elapsed time, and countdown values  
- `useRef` for storing interval IDs and start time without triggering re-renders  
- `useEffect` for controlling side effects and cleaning up intervals properly  
- Time calculations for both **counting up** (stopwatch) and **counting down** (timer)  
- Accurate time formatting including **milliseconds**  
- Separation of logic for two different modes in one app
