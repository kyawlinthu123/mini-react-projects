# ⚛️ Mini React Projects

A collection of small React.js projects built while exploring different ideas and practicing frontend concepts.
Each project is simple, focused, and created to experiment with React features in a hands-on way.

#🌱 Notes

Each project is self-contained.
Node modules are ignored in version control for a lighter repo.
More projects will be added along the way.
